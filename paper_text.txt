Multi-Satellite Cooperative MIMO Transmission:
Statistical CSI-Aware RSMA Precoding Design
Sangwon Jo , Graduate Student Member, IEEE , and Seok-Hwan Park , Senior Member, IEEE
Abstract—We investigate inter-satellite cooperative transmis-
sion in a multiple low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication
system to enhance spectral efﬁciency. Speciﬁcally, we design
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) precoding at LEO satel-
lites for cooperative rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA).
Given the difﬁculty of acquiring instantaneous channel state
information (iCSI) due to long delays and Doppler effects, we for-
mulate an ergodic max-min fairness rate (MMFR) maximization
problem based on statistical CSI (sCSI). To address the challenge
of ergodic rate evaluation, we approximate the problem using
closed-form upper bounds and develop a weighted minimum
mean squared error-based algorithm to obtain a stationary
point. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed sCSI-
based RSMA scheme approaches iCSI-based performance and
signiﬁcantly outperforms conventional space-division multiple
access.

ASSIVE multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) uti-
lizes a large number of antennas to deliver reliable
and high data-rate communication links [1]. Several recent
works have investigated mMIMO transmission for satel-
lite communication (SATCOM) using low-Earth-orbit (LEO)
satellites [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. In particular, [2] studied
the channel modeling and designed downlink precoders and
uplink receivers based on statistical channel state information
(sCSI), recognizing that acquiring instantaneous CSI (iCSI)
is highly challenging in LEO SATCOM due to impairments
such as propagation delay and Doppler shifts, whereas sCSI
remains stable over longer time scales. In [3],i tw a ss h o w n
that single-stream precoding maximizes the ergodic sum rate
even when each user terminal (UT) is equipped with multiple
antennas, owing to the rank-one nature of the channel matrices
between each LEO satellite and UT. In line with the growing
density of LEO satellite constellations [8], mMIMO transmis-
sion for multi-LEO SATCOM systems has been addressed
in [5], [6], [7]. While [5] and [6] considered coordinated trans-
mission and reception across satellites, where only CSI-related

parameters are exchanged among satellites, [7] investigated a
fully-cooperative transmission scheme in which multiple LEO
satellites exchange both CSI and UTs’ data via inter-satellite
links (ISLs).
While the aforementioned works focused on conven-
tional space-division multiple access (SDMA) techniques,
the integration of advanced rate-splitting multiple access
(RSMA) technique [9] into SATCOM systems was explored
in [10], [11], [12]. Speciﬁcally, [10] addressed RSMA-based
multigroup multicast beamforming in multi-beam SATCOM
systems under imperfect CSI, [11] investigated joint geosta-
tionary orbit (GEO) and LEO precoding and message splitting
in a hybrid GEO-multiple LEO network, and [12] focused on
energy-efﬁcient RSMA design in ISAC-enabled LEO satellite
systems. However, these works did not consider cooperative
transmission among multiple LEO satellites [10], [11], [12],
nor did they address practical optimization with sCSI in light
of challenges in acquiring iCSI [10], [12].
Motivated by these insights, this letter investigates the use
of RSMA for cooperative downlink mMIMO transmission in
a multiple-satellite SATCOM system, leveraging ISLs. Our
objective is to optimize the downlink precoder to maximize
the ergodic max-min fairness rate (MMFR) among UTs,
relying solely on sCSI. To circumvent the computational
burden of estimating the ergodic rate via sample averaging,
we reformulate the problem using a closed-form upper bound
on the ergodic rate. Given the non-convexity of the resulting
optimization problem, we develop a weighted minimum mean
square error (WMMSE)-based algorithm [13]. Numerical
results demonstrate that the proposed RSMA-based coopera-
tive scheme signiﬁcantly outperforms conventional SDMA and
non-cooperative baselines, achieving performance close to that
with perfect iCSI.
Main contributions of this letter are summarized as follows.
• We consider a multi-LEO SATCOM system with ISLs,
enabling cooperative mMIMO RSMA transmission for
effective interference management.
• Recognizing the challenges in acquiring iCSI, we lever-
age sCSI, which remains stable over longer periods.
We formulate the problem of optimizing the downlink
precoders to maximize the ergodic MMFR among UTs.
• To overcome the challenge of computing ergodic rates,
we reformulate the problem using closed-form upper
bounds. We then develop a WMMSE-based algorithm,
which guarantees a stationary point.
• Through numerical evaluations, we demonstrate that
the proposed sCSI-based RSMA scheme achieves
performance close to that of its iCSI-based counterpart,
outperforming conventional SDMA and non-cooperative
baseline schemes.

system with S = 4a n d K = 10.
II. S YSTEM MODEL
We consider a downlink transmission system in an NTN
comprising multiple LEO satellites, cooperating with each
other via ISLs, and ground UTs as shown in Fig. 1.
Speciﬁcally, we consider S LEO satellites at altitude H and K
UTs on the ground. Each satellite is equipped with a uniform
planar array (UPA) of M = MxMy antenna elements, where
Mx and My represent the number of antennas along the x-
axis and y-axis, respectively. Similarly, each UT is equipped
with a UPA consisting of N = Nx′ Ny′ elements, where Nx′
and Ny′ denote the number of antennas along the x′-axis and
the y′-axis. We deﬁne the index sets of satellites and UTs as
S = {1, 2,..., S} and K = {1, 2,..., K}, respectively. The
subset of satellites serving UT k ∈K is denoted by Sk , and
the subset of UTs served by satellites s ∈S is denoted by
Ks . Due to potential overlaps in satellite coverage areas, as
depicted in Fig. 1, we assume cooperative transmission among
satellites to jointly serve UTs within these overlapping regions.
A. Satellite-to-UT Channel Model
The received signal yk ∈CN×1 at each UT k is given by
yk =
∑
s∈S
Hk,sxs +zk = Hkx +zk, (1)
where Hk,s ∈ CN×M denotes the channel matrix from
satellite s to UT k, xs ∈ CM×1 is the transmit signal
vector from satellite s, and zk ∼C N(0,σ2zI) is the additive
noise vector. We deﬁne the aggregated channel matrix Hk ∈
CN×MS and the stacked transmitted signal vectorx ∈CMS×1
across all the satellites as Hk =[ Hk,1··· Hk,S ] and x =
[xH
1 ··· xH
S ]H , respectively.
Following [5], the channel matrix Hk,s is expressed as
Hk,s = dk,sgH
k,s, (2)
where dk,s ∈ CN×1 and gk,s ∈ CM×1 denote
the receive and transmit array response vectors at UT
k and satellite s, respectively. The array response vec-
tors for the l-th propagation path, denoted by d
k,s,l and
gk,s,l , are deﬁned as gk,s,l = ex(qx
k,s,l ) ⊗ ey(qy
k,s,l )
and dk,s,l = ex′ (qx′
k,s,l ) ⊗ey′ (qy′
k,s,l ), where the steer-
ing vector along axis v ∈{ x, y, x′, y′} is deﬁned as
ev(x )= 1
nv (1, e−j 2πdv
λ x,..., e−j 2π(nv−1) dv
λ x )T ∈ Cnv×1
with qv
k,s,l being the directional cosine of the l-th prop-
agation path along axis v, nv the number of antennas,
dv the antenna spacing, and λ the carrier wavelength.
The directional cosines for the l-th path are given by
qx
k,s,l =s i n θy
k,s,l cosθx
k,s,l, qy
k,s,l =c o s θy
k,s,l, qx′
k,s,l =
sinϕy′
k,s,l cosϕx′
k,s,l, and qy′
k,s,l =c o s ϕy′
k,s,l , where θx
k,s,l,
θy
k,s,l,ϕx′
k,s,l and ϕy′
k,s,l are the angles of the l-th path, as
illustrated in Fig. 1. Given the considerable distance between
LEO satellites and ground UTs, the multipath effects are
predominantly shaped by the scattering environment near the
UT. Therefore, the directional cosines for different paths
associated with the same UT can be approximated as constant,
i.e., q
x
k,s,l = qx
k,s and qy
k,s,l = qy
k,s [2]. As a result, the
transmit array response simpliﬁes to gk,s,l = gk,s , which
varies slowly over time and is assumed to be known at
satellite s [5].
On the other hand, the receive array responsedk,s,l may vary
with the path index l, and the overall receive response vector
dk,s is modeled as dk,s =
√
βk,sκk,s/(κk,s +1 )dk,s,0 +√
βk,s/(κk,s +1 )ˆdk,s , where dk,s,0 is the line-of-sight
(LoS) component derived from {ϕx′
k,s,0,ϕy′
k,s,0} satisfying
sin(ϕx′
k,s,0)s i n (ϕy′
k,s,0)=s i n αk,s . The parameter βk,s =
GsatGut/(4πDk,s/λ)2 denotes the average channel power with
the antenna gains Gsat and Gut, the propagation distance Dk,s ,
and the carrier wavelength λ. The Rician factor is denoted by
κk,s > 0, and ˆdk,s ∼C N(0,Σk,s ) represents the non LoS
(NLoS) component with covariance matrixΣk,s ⪰ 0 normalized
such that tr(Σk,s )=1 .
Based on the discussion above, the aggregated channel
matrix Hk from all satellites to UT k is given by
Hk = DkGH
k , (3)
where Dk =[ dk,1··· dk,S ] ∈ CN×S , and Gk =
blkdiag({gk,s}s∈S) ∈CMS×S .
We assume that each satellite s independently estimates
the local sCSI to its associated UTs, including the set
{βk,s,κk,s, gk,s, dk,s,0, Σk,s}k∈Ks . Since this sCSI is deter-
mined by relatively stable parameters such as the satellite-UT
geometry, we assume that it remains constant during the
precoding design phase [2]. After estimating sCSI, each satel-
lite subsequently shares its local sCSI with other cooperating
satellites via ISLs. Through this exchange, all participating
S satellites acquire access to the global sCSI required for
cooperative transmission. The delay due to sCSI exchange may
make the shared sCSI outdated, leading to imperfect sCSI. A
robust design with imperfect sCSI is left for future work.
B. Cooperative RSMA Transmission
To effectively manage inter-UT interference, we adopt the
RSMA framework [9]. Speciﬁcally, we deﬁne the data stream
vector as m =[ m
c, mp,1, mp,2,..., mp,K ]T ∈ C(K +1)×1,
where mc ∼C N(0, 1) represents the common data stream
intended for all UTs, and mp,k ∼CN (0, 1) denotes the private
data stream intended exclusively for UT k. The common
stream mc decoded by all UTs enables RSMA to manage
interference more ﬂexibly than SDMA [9], as both the beam-
forming vector for mc and the allocation of the common
rate among UTs can be jointly optimized. We assume the
presence of reliable ISLs, which enables the LEO satellites to
cooperatively transmit the data streams m.
At each satellite s, the data stream vector m is linearly
precoded into the transmit signal vector x
s using a precoding

matrix Qs =[ qc,s,qp,1,s,..., qp,K,s ] ∈ CM×(K +1),
where qc,s and {qp,k,s}k∈K denote the common and private
precoding vectors at satellite s, respectively. Deﬁning the
precoding matrix Q ∈ CMS×(K +1) stacked across all the
satellites as Q =[ QH
1 ··· QH
S ]H , the transmitted signal vector
x across all satellites is given by
x = Qm = qc mc +
∑
k∈K
qp,k mp,k, (4)
where qc =[ qH
c,1··· qH
c,S ]H ∈ CMS×1 and qp,k =
[qH
p,k,1··· qH
p,k,S ]H ∈CMS×1. Each satellite s should satisfy
a per-satellite transmit power constraint stated as ps (Q)=
tr(EHs (qcqHc + ∑
k∈Kqp,kqH
p,k )Es ) ≤ P, where P is the
transmit power budget per satellite, and Es ∈CMS×M is a
selection matrix consisting of zeros except for the rows from
M (s −1) + 1 to Ms, which form an identity matrix.
UT k decodes the common data stream mc and its own
private stream mp,k using successive interference cancellation
(SIC) decoding. Unlike the private streams, the common
stream should be decoded by all UTs. Accordingly, the ergodic
rates of the common and private streams are given by R

sents the maximum ergodic rate at which the common stream
mc can be decoded by UT k. The overall data rate for each
UT k is given by Rk = Rc,k + Rp,k , where Rc,k ≥0 is the
portion of the common data rate allocated to UT k, subject to
the constraint ∑
k∈KRc,k = Rc.
III. P ROPOSED S CSI-A WA R EOPTIMIZATION
To ensure the fairness among UTs, we aim to optimize the
precoding matrix Q to maximize the MMFR metric, 1 deﬁned
as mink∈KRk (i.e., the minimum ergodic rate across all UTs),
while satisfying the power constraints at all LEO satellites.
This optimization problem can be formulated as

where R = {Rj,l}j∈{c,p},l∈K. The constraint (6e) ensures
that each satellite s has access to the private data streams
intended only for its associated UTs Ks .
We note that the rate functions fc,k (Q) and fp,k (Q) do not
admit closed-form expressions and typically require compu-

using tractable closed-form upper bounds on the ergodic rates,
as presented in Proposition 1.

and fp,k (Q) in (5), are upper bounded as fc,k (Q) ≤f UB

Although the reformulated problem (9) is more tractable
than (6), it remains non-convex due to the constraints (9b)
and (9c). In what follows, we propose a WMMSE-based
algorithm to address this challenge.
The upper bound rate function f UB
c,k (Q) in (7a) measures
the achievable rate of the common data stream mc when
decoded from the virtual received signal ˆyc,k = ˆHkqc mc +∑
l∈K ˆHkqp,l mp,l +zk , where ˆHk is a known sCSI-dependent
matrix, as deﬁned in Proposition 1. Similarly, the private
upper bound rate f UB
p,k (Q) in (7b) corresponds to decod-
ing the private stream mp,k from ˆyp,k = ˆHkqp,k mp,k +∑
l∈K\{k} ˆHkqp,l mp,l +zk .
With the observation above, we address problem (9)
using the WMMSE approach. Speciﬁcally, we deﬁne the
mean squared error (MSE) functions for the common and
private data streams as e

Note that for ﬁxed auxiliary variables {u, v}, the optimization
over the beamforming matrix Q in (12) becomes convex
and can be efﬁciently solved using standard convex solvers
such as CVX [15]. Conversely, for a ﬁxed Q, the optimal

the objective function can be monotonically improved by
alternately updating the block variables Q and {u,v}.T h e

nC = O(K 2M 3S 3). Additionally, we numerically conﬁrmed
that Algorithm 1 consistently converges within a few iterations
across all simulated cases.
IV . NUMERICAL RESULTS
This section presents numerical results to validate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Each satellite operates
at an altitude of H = 600 km and has a maximum nadir
angle ϑmax =3 0 ◦, resulting in overlapping service areas.
The system operates at a carrier frequency of 2 GHz with
a bandwidth of 50 MHz, and the noise temperature is set
to T
n = 290 K. We consider antenna conﬁgurations of
[Mx, My, Nx′, Ny′ ]=[ 5 , 5, 4, 4] with antenna spacings being
[dx, dy, dx′, dy′ ]=[ λ,λ,λ
2, λ
2 ]. The antenna gains are set to
[Gsat, Gut]=[ 6 , 0] dBi. The Rician factor follows the S-
band suburban scenario speciﬁed in [17]. UTs are randomly
distributed within the combined service areas of the satellites.
The maximum elevation angle αmax is determined by the
maximum nadir angle ϑmax, and the corresponding maximum
distance Dmax deﬁnes the coverage boundary of each satellite.
The association between satellites and UTs is established
based on the distance D
k,s :i fU T k falls within the service
area of satellite s (i.e., Dk,s ≤ Dmax), then UT k and
satellite s belong to Ks and Sk , respectively. The covariance
matrix of the NLoS component Σk,s is set as Σk,s =
diag({μn}N
n=1) with μn =˜μn/∑N
l=1 ˜μl , where ˜μ1,..., ˜μN
are independently sampled from U (0, 1). The noise variance
σ2z is given by kB Tn B with the Boltzmann constant kB .
To validate the effectiveness of the proposed sCSI-aware
design for the multi-satellite cooperative RSMA transmission
scheme, we compare the average MMFR achieved by RSMA
and SDMA under both iCSI and sCSI conditions. For the
sCSI case, we utilize the upper bounds on the ergodic rates
for precoding optimization, as detailed in Section III, while
the MMFR performance of the resulting precoding matrix is
evaluated using the actual ergodic rate functions, computed via
sample-mean approximation with 20,000 channel realizations.
As a baseline, we also show the performance of precoders
designed solely based on the LoS components, i.e., directional
CSI (dCSI). Additionally, we include the performance of non-
cooperative transmission schemes, where each UT is served
solely by its nearest satellite. The performance of SDMA is
evaluated by setting the beamforming vector for the common
data stream to a zero vector, i.e., q
c = 0.

Fig. 2. Average MMFR versus transmit power P.
Fig. 3. Average MMFR versus the number of satellites S.
Fig. 2 illustrates the average MMFR as a function of
satellite transmit power, for a SATCOM system with S = 4
and K = 6. For both cooperative RSMA and SDMA schemes,
the sCSI-aware design achieves performance that closely
approaches that of the iCSI-based design. This is primarily
due to the rank-1 nature of the channel matrices, as described
in (2), where the basis vector g
k,s of the one-dimensional row
space of Hk,s is included in the sCSI set. The performance
gain of RSMA over SDMA becomes more pronounced as the
transmit power P increases. This is because the signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) at the UTs increases with P, and at higher SNRs,
interference, which is more effectively handled by RSMA than
SDMA, becomes the main performance bottleneck rather than
noise. Moreover, the performance gap between RSMA and
SDMA is more signiﬁcant in the multi-satellite cooperative
scenario enabled by ISLs, compared to the non-cooperative
transmission case. This highlights the synergistic beneﬁts
of combining RSMA with cooperative satellite transmission
strategies. The performance loss of the dCSI case compared
to sCSI is more pronounced at SDMA than RSMA, indicating
that the RSMA scheme is more robust to CSI imperfections.
Fig. 3 shows the average MMFR while increasing the number
of LEO satellites S, for a SATCOM system with K = 6 and
P = 15 dBW. As the number of satellites increases, each UT
is more likely to fall within overlapping coverage areas of
multiple satellites. This leads to improved SNR at the UTs,
resulting in more pronounced performance gains of RSMA
over SDMA. Furthermore, as satellite density increases with
larger S, the beneﬁts of inter-satellite cooperation enabled by
ISLs become more evident. These observations support the
effectiveness of the proposed approach that integrates RSMA
with multi-satellite cooperative transmission, particularly in
large-scale satellite constellations such as Starlink and OneWeb.

ONCLUSION
We have studied the design of mMIMO precoding at LEO
satellites for inter-satellite cooperative RSMA transmission.
Considering the challenges in acquiring iCSI in SATCOM,
we based the precoding design solely on sCSI. To handle
the difﬁculty of computing ergodic rates, we approximated
the ergodic MMFR maximization problem using closed-form
upper bounds and developed a WMMSE-based algorithm.
Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed sCSI-based
scheme closely approaches the performance of the iCSI-
based counterpart, except in scenarios dominated by NLoS
components. Furthermore, the performance gain of RSMA
over SDMA becomes more signiﬁcant when combined with
inter-satellite cooperative transmission.
